The recursive definition of countPairs in the Result class computes the number of distinct flavor pairs whose costs add up to a given amount m. It recursively checks pairs of flavors (i, j), where i is the index of the first flavor and j is the index of the next flavor, ensuring that i is always less than j to avoid duplicate pairs. The recursion advances by incrementing both i and j to the next indices, and the memoization table memo stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. The overall count is obtained by iterating over all possible starting indices for i and invoking the countPairs method for each pair, accumulating the total number of valid pairs.
